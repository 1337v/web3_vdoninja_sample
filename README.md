This project uses IOTA.org blockchain as a handshake server for VDO.Ninja.  IOTA is a fee-less blockchain with the ability to transact up to 32-kb values between addresses with a approximate 10-second transfer time.

This blockchain-based VDO.Ninja project can be accessed on the Fleek-hosted distributed network, making it even more decentralized. https://web3.vdo.ninja

I haven't yet bought a distributed domain name for this project, but if you wish buy an HNS domain name (Decentralized) for yourself, please consider using the following link to do so:  https://www.namebase.io/register/mmn18c  It's a Referral link that provides me credits to buy HNS domain names for my open-source projects, assuming you buy your own HNS domain with the link.

Anyways, in the near future it should be possible to have VDO.Ninja operate completely decentralized, even if servers are not really eliminated completely. Once the handshake is completed though, servers are no longer needed, and the power of VDO.Ninja's mesh-network really shines.
